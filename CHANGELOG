#### 0.1.7 - 2017-03-31
##### Added
- Click on the headers in the controller window to expand and collapse the top section
- Click on the logo to go back to that beautiful start look

##### Improved
- The logo now sits prettily above the search bar full-time
- The macOS logo isn't enormous anymore

#### 0.1.6 - 2017-03-15
##### Added
- When presenting a Shabad, spacebar will bring you back to the current line
- You can change the main line when presenting a Shabad by clicking on the 'home' icon on the line and spacebar will take you there
- *Shortcut*
  - Check for updates Ctrl+U (win) Cmd+U (mac)

##### Improved
- When an update is available, then app no longer restarts unexpectedly. This was a slightly jarring, especially when the user had already started searching. You will now be given the option of clicking to restart and install the latest version.
- English translations are now larger by default by user request

#### 0.1.5 - 2017-03-02
##### Added
- *Windows Keyboard Shortcuts*
 	- Ctrl+Q - Quit
 	- Ctrl+, - Preferences

##### Improved
- *UI* - Windows users will now see a custom frame around the window instead of the Windows default
- *Logo* - "To The" was hard to see on slides, so there's a new logo specifically for the presenter window

#### 0.1.4 - 2017-02-25
##### Added
- *Shortcut* - When presenting a Shabad, press spacebar to go back to the main line (marked by a home icon)

##### Improved
- *Headings* - The names of the sections in the controller have been improved to provide clarity of what each of them is

##### Fixed
- *Error* - Fixed an error that was displayed on startup if the device was offline

#### 0.1.3 - 2017-02-24
##### Added
- *Theme(s)* - The presenter window has two beautiful themes defined now: Light and Dark. Sure, you can't change your preference yet, but that setting will come in another build soon. For now, we set the Light theme as the default

##### Improved
- *Database* - A lot of garbled text has been removed from the Gurmukhi.

#### 0.1.2 - 2017-02-22
##### Improved
- *Presenter* - Faster and more even sizing/spacing. Major under-the-hood changes were also done that will allow us to do some really cool things.

#### 0.1.1 - 2017-02-21
##### Added
- *Keyboard shortcut* - Type the "/" character to give focus to the search field
- *Gurmukhi Keyboard* - While there is a small percentage of people who can type better in Gurmukhi than English, a larger group could use help with inputting the letters, so we added a Gurmukhi keyboard. Simply click on the keyboard icon in the search field and click the letters to search! It hides when you click on a result and will come back automatically when you want to search again.

#### 0.1.0 - 2017-02-17
It's been a while, but we've really been busy on this last build! You can tell it's big because we incremented the <i>minor revision</i> number in the version. We didn't want to send a broken app down the pipe, so we made sure that things were dialed. There's been an overhaul under the hood. You won't see the difference but we've made it much easier for development to continue at a faster rate.

##### Improved
- Search
	- *Speed* - Search speed has been tweaked and is faster than ever. Seriously, it's blazing fast
	- *Smarts* - When you press the arrows, you don't want a search to happen. Now we'll only search if you're actually typing

##### Added
- UI
	- *Animations* - Panels now open and close depending on where the focus of the app is to give more real estate to what matters.
- Settings
	- *Search Results* - Choose which fields you would like to display in the search results
	- *Close button* - Oh, you wanted to be able to close the settings after you opened them? Well, there's an Ã— button to be able to do that, now. BTW, you can use the "esc" key as well.

##### Updated
- UI
	- *Animations* - Animation performance has been improved

#### 0.0.10 - 2017-02-09
##### Added
- *Menu Items* - This is the start of making things more mouse-friendly
- *Settings* - This looks exciting! However, sadly, it's just a shell right now, but much goodness will come. Open with Cmd+, or Ctrl+, and close with esc

#### 0.0.9 - 2017-02-08
##### Added
- Translations, Transliterations, Raag, and Author added to search results, and they're pretty!</li>

##### Updated
- Ever try playing with the window size to see how big or small you can go? Well, we set a limit to how small the controller can be and still remain usable. At least, usable in the future.
- Closing the main window closes the viewer and, ultimately, exits the app. What do you think? Email us at techsupport@khalisfoundation.org

#### 0.0.8 - 2017-02-07
##### Added
- Keyboard shortcuts! The first couple with more to come. Use the arrow keys to navigate the Shabad Controller. The main window needs to have focus

#### 0.0.7 - 2017-01-19
##### Added
- This cool new changelog so you know what we've been up to!
- A shiny new logo! Actually, it's the same one, but it's got a "BETA" wordmark to let you know that we've got lots more to come
- You know when you get the size and position of the app to exactly how you like it? Well, the app now remembers and will restore to that the next time you use it.
- Session window getting unmanageably long? Clear it out with the click of an 'X'
- Continuing the session window love, the current Shabad gets highlighted and new Shabads get added to the top of the list

#### 0.0.6
##### Added
- Shabad controller scrolls to searched line
- "Installing..." GIF when installing on Windows
